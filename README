I've implemented a linux shell and a clone shell like program using system calls like fork,execve,etc as a part of the CSL333-Operating Systems 
course at IIT-Ropar.

The source code are the .c files.

The implementation assumes that you've the readline library in /usr/lib.

If not install it using:
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

To run makefile.Download all the source codes and the make file in a single directory and type make on the terminal in that directory.

After that type ./myshell to execute myshell.c or ./closh to execute closh.c

The shelldoc.pdf tells about what all has been implemented in the myshell.c and closh.c files.
