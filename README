I've implemented a linux shell and a clone shell like program using system calls like fork,execve,etc.

The source code are the .c files.

The implementation assumes that you've the readline library in /usr/lib.

If not install it using:
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

A makefile has been provided in Jaskaran_2011CS1012 folder.

To run makefile.Go to the directory Jaskaran_2011CS1012 after unzipping the tar archive and then type make on the terminal.

After that type ./myshell to execute myshell.c or ./closh to execute closh.c
