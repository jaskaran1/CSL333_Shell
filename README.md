Implementation of Linux Shell like behavior using system calls like fork,execve,etc.

This was a course project in Operating Systems course at IIT-Ropar.

The implementation assumes that you've the readline library in /usr/lib.

If not install it using:

sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

Clone and make.

After that type ./myshell to execute myshell.c or ./closh to execute closh.c

The shelldoc.pdf tells about what all has been implemented in the myshell.c and closh.c files.
